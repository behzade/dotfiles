# Daemon Plugin Plan

- AI-powered code generation and editing.
- Chat interface for AI interaction.
- Context awareness (buffer, diagnostics, project).
- Actions: Generate, explain, refactor, fix, answer questions.
- LSP integration.
- Treesitter integration.

## UI/UX Priorities

- Single Unified Sidebar: Use one floating window for the entire AI interaction, avoiding multiple splits.
- Manual Rendering within Sidebar: Implement custom rendering logic for chat history, input, context, etc., within the sidebar buffer.
- Rich Interactions: Support keyboard (and mouse) for selecting elements (text, files, commands) within the sidebar.
- Actionable Elements: Render files/commands as interactive components (e.g., click/select to open/run).
- Integrated Command Execution: Execute commands from the sidebar and feed results back to the LLM.
- Context Integration Display: Visually integrate LSP diagnostics and other context into the sidebar.
- Icon Integration: Use nvim-web-devicons for visual cues.
- Theme Adaptability: Make sure UI elements respect the user's Neovim colorscheme.
- Keyboard-Driven Navigation: Prioritize efficient keyboard controls for all UI interactions.
